#+TITLE: Org Notes to Netlify
* Introduction
This converts a directory ~./content~ of org files into html and creates a simple alphabetized index of notes.
* Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Create Netlify account linked to cloned repo.
3. In Netlify Build Settings change "Build command" to ~./build.sh~ and "Publish directory" to ~dist/~.
4. Add content to the content directory.
5. Git add, commit, and push.
6. ???
7. Profit!
* Title_fix
This is an a freebie that I wrote to convert the default titles Org (or perhaps Doom) creates for an Org file if the named has underscores. Converts "_" to a space in the title line. It makes backups, but you should probably commit the org files before running this just in case.
* Other Thoughts
I wrote this to fill an immediate needs. It's very basic, and could easily be improved upon. But I didn't want to put too much effort into converting from Org to HTML, and just wanted to get my notes posted. Contributions are welcome.
